  abstract = {Decoding random linear codes is a well studied problem with many applications in complexity theory and cryptography. The security of almost all coding and LPN/LWE-based schemes relies on the assumption that it is hard to decode random linear codes. Recently, there has been progress in improving the running time of the best decoding algorithms for binary random codes. The ball collision technique of Bernstein, Lange and Peters lowered the complexity of Stern's information set decoding algorithm to 20.0556n. Using representations this bound was improved to 20.0537n by May, Meurer and Thomae. We show how to further increase the number of representations and propose a new information set decoding algorithm with running time 20.0494n.},

  abstract = {Hamming Quasi-Cyclic (HQC) is a code-based candidate of NIST post-quantum standardization procedure. The decoding steps of code-based cryptosystems are known to be vulnerable to side-channel attacks and HQC is no exception to this rule. In this paper, we present a new key recovery side-channel attack on HQC with chosen ciphertext. Our attack takes advantage of the reuse of a static secret key on a micro-controller with a physical access. The goal is to retrieve the static secret key by targeting the Reed-Muller decoding step of the decapsulation and more precisely the Hadamard transform. This function is known for its diffusion property, a property that we exploit through sidechannel analysis. The side-channel information is used to build an Oracle that distinguishes between several decoding patterns of the Reed-Muller codes. We show how to query the Oracle such that the responses give a full information about the static secret key. Experiments show that less than 20.000 electromagnetic attack traces are sufficient to retrieve the whole static secret key used for the decapsulation. Finally, we present a masking-based countermeasure to thwart our attack.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the first chosen-ciphertext (CC) cache-timing attacks on the reference implementation of HQC. We build a cache-timing based distinguisher for implementing a plaintext-checking (PC) oracle. The PC oracle uses side-channel information to check if a given ciphertext decrypts to a given message. This is done by identifying a vulnerability during the generating process of two vectors in the reference implementation of HQC. We also propose a new method of using PC oracles for chosen-ciphertext side-channel attacks against HQC, which may have independent interest.},
